# PokemonAutoPlayer

PokemonAutoPlayer is a Work-In-Progress project whose sole purpose is to play the entire Pokemon Emerald (GBA emulator version) without any user input, other than preset checkpoints. The entirety of the game (movement, combat, and other aspects) is played by a self-learning AI, using mainly OCR.
